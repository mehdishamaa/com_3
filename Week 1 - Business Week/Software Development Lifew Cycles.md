**Waterfall:**

- More traditional approach
- Very linear
- Used when requirements are clear from the outset and no changes are anticipated
- Used when constrained by time or budget

**Agile:**

- Iteration through cycles, typically in sprints
- Focuses on change and adaptability
- Can be more expensive and take longer than other methods

**V-Model:**

- Uses a verification process to confirm whether the specification meets the customer's needs
- Uses measures of performance
- Follows sequential AS WELL AS parallel development flow

**_Network Diagrams:_**

- Used to represent how activities start, end and how long they last
- Helpful to show workflow of project activities
- Can help produce a time estimate for a project
- However, complex networks can be difficult to read and can change quickly over time, rendering them inaccurate

  - To calculate float of each task, work right to left and subtract duration from a task's latest end date
  
  - The critical path is the path which would result in the latest end date
