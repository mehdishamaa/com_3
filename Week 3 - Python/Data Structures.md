#Data Structures

##Lists

What is a list?: A list is a collection of elements of data. We are able to add to or remove these elements from the list.

Assume we have created the below list:

```
car_types = ['honda', 'BMW', 'mercedes']

print(car_types[0])

```

The above code would output the 0 index in the list, which in this case would be 'honda'.

Here is a list of methods we can use with lists:

**Looping through lists:**

``` 
magicians = ['alice', 'david', 'carolina'] 

for magician in magicians:

print(magician)
```

The above code loops through the list of magician, printing the name of each magician.
