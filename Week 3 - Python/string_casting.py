# x = 10
# y = 11

# print(x == y) # Checking the values as a Boolean resulting True or False
# print(x != y) # Checking the values as a Boolean resulting True or False
# print(x > y)
# print(x < y)
# print(x <= y)

# Let us now use a real life example to understand operators better:

# age = 18
# print(age < 19)

# Double quotes vs single quotes (no difference, although using double quotes is better practice):

# print("Hello World!")
# print('Hello World!')


# strings - casting - slicing - concatenation:

greeting_welcome = "Hello World!"
# H E L L O W O R L D
# 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

#print(len(greeting_welcome))
# The above code shows us how many characters are in the string


# String slicing:

# hi = "Hello World!"

# print(hi[10])

# print(hi[6:11])

# The first print command prints the tenth character in the string.
# The second print command prints the sixth character up to the eleventh character.

# print(hi[-6:-1])

# This print command using reverse indexing to print world.


# Boolean value within DATA types:

use_text = "Here's some text with lots of text"

# count() counts the substring within the string

# print(use_text.count("text"))
# The above command asks for the count of the substring "text" within the string, returning a value of 2.
